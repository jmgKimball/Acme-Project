    <textOnly>Hi {!CareProgramEnrollee.Patient_Name__c},

We are pleased to let you know you have been enrolled in Komen’s Patient Navigation Program. A patient navigator can help you by:  

·       guiding you through the health care system;  
·       advocating on your behalf to improve communication with your health care providers;  
·       working with you to find the resources and support you need;  
·       helping you find appropriate sources to pay for your health care needs;  
·       and helping you arrange for appropriate services so you can keep your health care appointments.  

One of our patient navigators will be reaching out to you shortly to schedule a time to connect and learn more about your needs.

Our breast care helpline is also available to answer questions, provide support, and connect you with local resources. (1-877 GO KOMEN/1-877-465-6636 or email helpline@komen.org).

Thanks,
